1.0  27/05/1999  Brian
     Original version

1.01 04/06/1999, Cheesy
     Ported client only to Cygwin.
      - Added #ifdefs for CLIENT
      - Worked around some missing functions
     Changed all occurences of client response to 'ALLOW'.
      - ADD and AUTH were used in some places.

1.1  21/06/1999, Cheesy
     Changed protocol to be non repeatable.
      - Detects back-ass clients and prompts them to upgrade.
      - All 'codes' stuff now removed.
      - Protocol documentation (ie: comments) updated.
     Now rejects invalid USER strings the same as invalid PERMIT/AUTH
     The host may now be specified by IP as well as by hostname.
     Now uses getservbyname("ipscromp", "tcp").
      - Can also fallback to DEFAULT_PORT
     Format of some messages changed slightly for readability.
     Some code cleanup / tidying (IMO @ any rate)
     ** This version not tested for Cygwin **

2.0  23/06/1999, Cheesy
     Complete re-write, using the new protocol.
      - ipscromp and in.ipscrompd now separate binaries.
      - Relies heavily on stdargs to make code tidier.
     Client now checks the IP (range) before sending it.
     No longer invokes fwcfg via /bin/sh
     Now supports debugging of in.ipscrompd via syslog
     ** New client not tested under Cygwin **
      - In fact, it almost certainly won't work.

2.1  09/07/1999, Cheesy
     Shuffled code around so that add_ip_range() may be in a separate file.
     Wrote code to manipulate Linux 2.0 & 2.2 firewalls directly.
      - Look in fw_linux.c
      - Previous code may still be used - see fw_program.c
     Changed some messages to be more generic, since we can't tell
       exactly how the firewall is being manipulated in in.ipscrompd
     ** Client still not tested for Cygwin **

2.1a 09/01/2000, Cheesy
     Fixed up for Cygwin.
       - Cywin doesnt seem to have inet_aton() so you cannot
         specify the alternate target host by IP. Sorry folks.

2.2  29/01/2000, Cheesy
     Protocol changes so that IP is no longer excahnged,
       only client IP is allowed to be added to the rules.
      - Challenge string lengthened to keep Ian happy.
      - Also added protocol field to USER command.
     Support for rotating ip chains so that IPs can be only open
       for a certain amount of time.
      - See fw_linux.c and flush_chains
     Internal changes so that a struct in_addr is passed around,
       instead of the IP string. See fw.h
     All references to 'pin' removed, replaced with password.

2.21 12/05/2000, Cheesy
     Fixed screwed up logic in fw_linux.c where I used hour % 3
       when I really wanted hour / 8.
       (No, I dont know what I was thinking either)
     Bugfixes for flush_chains:
      - Logic changed to behave correctly instead of mimicing previously
        incorrect fw_linux.c behaviour (see above)
      - date +%H changed to +%k to avoid bash getting confused with 09
      - arg parsing fixed so it doesnt blow up if invoked with no args

2.3  23/11/2000, Cheesy
     Protocol updates/improvements
       - Protocol v2 uses SHA instead of MD5
       - New IPERMIT command allows other IP addresses to be opened
       - Now uses md5 & sha implementations from libmd (ie: Non RSA)
     ipscromp command line switches changed to be ssh compatible
     Small changes to a few error messages

2.31 11/09/2001, Cheesy
     Fixed to compile on BSD
     fw_program.c now compiles (!) plus small error handling improvements

2.4  26/04/2003, Cheesy
     Imported (with mods) ian's modularisation of authentication
      - This will make it easier to add alternative auth methods in future
      - Some associated cleanup and rearranging
     Switched from libmd to libcrypto
      - Discovered SHA1 vs. SHA0 the hard way :-/
      - libmd components no longer bundled
      - See Makefile and/or INSTALL for more info
     Username now passed to firewall opening module
      - This will allow different behavior based on username
      - fw_program.o now passes this as argv[2] to the called program
      - open_ip changed to not object to $2 but does nothing with it
     Fixed an off-by-one in recv_sock (Thanks arcas!)
      - Probably not exploitable but could cause binary cack to be
        passed around internally and to syslog()
      - Also reduced another buffer by one byte, just to keep ian happy
        (Off-by-one the safe way!)
     Client changes so 'alternate IP' (-i) can actually be a hostname
     Added timeout to in.ipscrompd to reduce DoS possibilities
     Cleanup of a couple of messages
     Added (fairly loose) installation docs (see INSTALL)
       and a make install target

2.4.1 11/05/2003, Cheesy
     Fixed to compile correctly again with libmd (SHA vs SHA1 stuff)
     Removed old Cygwin specific workarounds that are now unnecessary

2.4.2 07/08/2003, Cheesy
     Fixed bug in in.ipscrompd.c where the alt_ip in IPERMIT was ignored

2.4.3 24/09/2003, Cheesy
     ipscromp.c re-written so you can use one password with multiple hosts
     Added fw_touch.c, FW_OBJ that creates files
      - Files are named with the IP that was opened, like for open_ip
      - Each file contains the name of the user the opened that IP
     Fixed bug in in.ipscrompd.c where sending no data and
       closing the connection caused a core
     Fixed bug in the open_ip from 2.4 or newer that simply didn't work
      - open_ip now writes the username as in fw_touch.c
     Fixed to compile under solaris/i386
